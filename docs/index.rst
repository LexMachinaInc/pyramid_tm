pyramid_tm
==========

Overview
--------

``pyramid_tm`` is a package which allows :term:`Pyramid` requests to join
the active :term:`transaction` as provided by the :term:`transaction` package.

Installation
------------

Install using setuptools, e.g. (within a virtualenv)::

  $ easy_install pyramid_tm

Setup
-----

Once ``pyramid_tm`` is installed, you must use the ``config.include``
mechanism to include it into your Pyramid project's configuration.  In your
Pyramid project's ``__init__.py``:

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   config = Configurator(.....)
   config.include('pyramid_tm')

From now on, whenever a new request is setup from an application using
``config``, a new transaction is associated with that request.

.. note::

   When the ``repoze.tm`` or ``repoze.tm2`` middleware is in the WSGI
   pipeline, ``pyramid_tm`` becomes inactive.

:term:`transaction` Usage
-------------------------

At the beginning of a request a new :term:`transaction` is started
using the ``transaction.begin()`` function.  Once the request has
finished all of it's works (ie views have finished running), a few checks
are tested:

  1) Did some a transaction.doom() cause the transaction to become "doomed"?
     if so, ``transaction.abort()``.

  2) Did an exception occur in the underlying code? if so,
     ``transaction.abort()``

  3) Did the :func:`pyramid.tm.default_commit_veto` callback, called with the
     response generated by the application, return a result that evaluates to
     ``True``? if so, ``transaction.abort()``.  The default commit veto
     vetoes a commit if the status code starts with ``4`` or ``5`` or there
     is a ``X-Tm`` response header with a value that does not equal
     ``commit``.

If none of these checks called ``transaction.abort()`` then the
transaction is instead committed using ``transaction.commit()``.

By itself, this :term:`transaction` machinery doesn't do much.  It is
up to third-party code to *join* the active transaction to benefit.

See `repoze.filesafe <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/repoze.filesafe>`_ for an
example of how files creation can be committed or rolled back based on
:term:`transaction` and the `pyramid_mailer
<http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid_mailer/dev/>`_ package to see
how you can prevent emails from being sent until a transaction succeeeds.

Replacing the Default Commit Veto
---------------------------------

Pyramid's default "commit veto" logic looks something like this:

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   def default_commit_veto(request, response):
       xtm = response.headers.get('x-tm')
       if xtm is not None:
           if xtm == 'commit':
               return False
           return True
       status = response.status
       for bad in ('4', '5'):
           if status.startswith(bad):
               return True
       return False

This code is present in the ``pyramid_tm`` package as
``pyramid_tm.default_commit_veto``.  If you do not specify a custom commit
veto function, this logic is used.

If you'd like to replace the default "commit veto" callback, create a
function with the same signature (``request``, ``response``) and return value
(``True`` or ``False``), then pass a ``pyramid_tm.commit_veto`` setting to
your :term:`Configurator`.

Via Python:

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   from pyramid.config import Configurator

   def app(global_conf, settings):
       settings['pyramid_tm.commit_veto'] = commit_veto
       config = Configurator(settings=settings)
       config.include('pyramid_tm')

Via PasteDeploy:

.. code-block:: ini
   :linenos:

   [app:myapp]
   pyramid_tm.commit_veto = my.package.commit_veto

In the PasteDeploy example, the path is a Python dotted name, where the dots
separate module and package names, and the colon separates a module from its
contents.  In the above example, the code would be implemented as a
"commit_veto" function which lives in the "package" submodule of the "my"
package.
