Next release
------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

- The transaction manager has been converted to a Pyramid 1.1.1 "tween"
  (instead of an event subscriber).

Backwards Incompatibilities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Incompatible with Pyramid < 1.1.1.  Use version 0.2 if you need
  compatibility with older Pyramids.

- ``pyramid_tm`` no longer attempts to roll back the transaction if the
  downstream application returns a response with a particular status code by
  default (it no longer configures a default "commit veto").  If you need the
  old behavior, explicitly add the following to your Paste application
  configuration (insert the ``pyramid_tm.commit_veto`` line into your app's
  section; the "myapp" section below is just a sample)::

     [app:myapp]
     pyramid_tm.commit_veto = pyramid_tm.default_commit_veto

- A commit veto is now called with two arguments: ``request`` and
  ``response``.  The ``request`` is the webob request that caused the
  transaction manager to become active.  The ``response`` is the response
  returned by the Pyramid application.  The previous call signature of a
  commit veto accepted three arguments: ``environ``, ``status``, and
  ``headers``.  Here's a simple wrapper script that will allow you to
  use your existing custom commit veto function::

     def bwcompat_commit_veto_wrapper(request, response):
         return my_custom_commit_veto(request.environ, request.status, 
                                      request.headerlist)

0.2 (2011-07-18)
----------------

- A new header ``X-Tm`` is now honored by the ``default_commit_veto`` commit
veto hook. If this header exists in the headerlist, its value must be a
string. If its value is ``commit``, the transaction will be committed
regardless of the status code or the value of ``X-Tm-Abort``. If the value
of the ``X-Tm`` header is ``abort`` (or any other string value except
``commit``), the transaction will be aborted, regardless of the status code
or the value of ``X-Tm-Abort``.

0.1 (2011-02-23)
----------------

- Initial release, based on repoze.tm2
